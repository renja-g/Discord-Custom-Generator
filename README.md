# Discord Custom Team Generator

## Overview
The Discord Custom Team Generator is an elegantly simple bot designed for Discord. Its primary function is to create balanced teams from a group of participants, each with a custom rating. The bot ensures fairness by analyzing these ratings to determine the most equitable team compositions.

## Features
- **Custom Rating System**: You can assign each participant a custom rating to reflect their skill level.
- **Fair Team Allocation**: The bot evaluates all possible team combinations to find the fairest distribution of participants based on their ratings.
- **Randomized Selection**: Once the fairest team compositions are determined, the bot randomly selects one of these optimal combinations to add a bit of variety to each game.

## How It Works
Use the `!command_list` command to see a list of all available commands. The bot will respond with a list of commands and their descriptions.
